### Description
Find connected component in undirected graph.

Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.

(A connected component of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.)

You need return a list of label set.
